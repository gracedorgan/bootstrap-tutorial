I definitely can see using Bootstrap when I'm under time constraints. It's pretty amazing how quick it was to make a decent-looking website with a view nice effects. I can also see using this to throw up a prototype of something on the web.

I don't think using Bootstrap to make a website for a paying client would be a great idea, especially because the websites tend to look the same.
